Privacy Policy

Effective Date: [January 1st 2026]

Tango (“Tango,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) values your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the Tango mobile application (the “App”).

By accessing or using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

1.3 Payment Information

All payments and subscriptions are processed by Apple App Store or Google Play. Tango does not collect, process, or store your payment card or billing information.

How We Use Your Information
We use your information to:

Photo Moderation and Safety
To protect users and maintain community standards, all uploaded photos are automatically reviewed using third-party content moderation services. These services help detect:

Nudity or sexually explicit content

Photos that do not meet our safety standards are rejected and deleted. Repeated violations may result in account suspension or termination.

How We Share Information
We do not sell your personal data.

With trusted service providers that help operate the App (such as hosting, analytics, and content moderation)

When required by law, regulation, or legal process

To protect the rights, safety, or security of Tango or its users

Data Storage and Security
We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect your information. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to safeguard data, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

Data Retention
We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to:

Provide the App and its features

Comply with legal and regulatory requirements

Resolve disputes and enforce agreements

When you delete your account, your profile information, photos, and associated data are permanently deleted, subject to applicable legal requirements.

Your Rights and Choices
Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

Correct inaccurate or incomplete information

Request deletion of your account and data

Most of these actions can be performed directly within the App.

Account Deletion
You may delete your account at any time through the App settings. Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.

Third-Party Services
The App may contain links to or integrate with third-party services. Tango is not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective upon posting. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
